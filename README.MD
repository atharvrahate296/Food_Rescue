# FoodFlow Simulation

FoodFlow is a front-end logistics simulation demonstrating surplus food redistribution workflows.  

The interface visualizes:
- Donation posting  
- AI-based priority scoring  
- Driver assignment  
- Delivery tracking  
- Impact estimation  

This project is built purely for demonstration and academic presentation purposes.  
It does not include real backend systems, live routing engines, or production infrastructure.  

The goal is to showcase system flow and user interaction in a controlled simulated environment.
